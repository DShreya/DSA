#HashTable

A HASH TABLE is a data structure that stores values using a pair of keys and values. 
Each value is assigned a unique key that is generated using a hash function.

The name of the key is used to access its associated value. 
This makes searching for values in a hash table very fast, irrespective of the number of items in the hash table.
